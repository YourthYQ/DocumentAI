# This file makes the 'services' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally expose certain functions or classes at the package level
# for easier importing, e.g.:
# from .conversation_manager import get_conversation_history
# from .document_processor import extract_text_from_pdf

# For now, keeping it empty is fine.
